# Hi I'm buhrmi

I used to be a web developer, but then I founded the Shitty Investments Club. Now I work as an independent crypto broker and travel the world.

Feel free to [reach out](https://www.shitcoinswap.com/about) if you'd like to join the team.

## Current projects

- [Momentum](https://github.com/momentum-foundation/whitepaper), an experimental blockchain platform implementing Proof-of-Popularity (PoP). 
- [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinswap.com), my very own poop-branded, open-source trading platform.
  
## Open Source
