## Hi there

I'm a full-stack web developer from Germany, currently living in Da Nang, Vietnam.

I specialize in developing **native-feeling, offline-capable web apps** using Ruby on Rails, Svelte, Capacitor.js, and a sweet selection of my own open source packages:

- [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)<br>
  Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's client-side adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component, inspired by Hotwire's Turbo Frames.

- Inertia X NavStack (coming soon)<br>
  A component library offering buttery smooth native-like navigation for Inertia X apps.

- [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)<br>
  LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time. These stores can be persisted locally for true offline-support.

Together, this gives you:

- Buttery smooth native-feeling navigations and interactions on mobile as well as in browsers
- Locally cacheable data for true offline-support
- SSR support for search engine optimizations
- All while using standard Rails controllers and actions, without having to develop an API
- Easily testable and extremely maintainable code

Intrigued? Feel free to reach out with your ideas at [hello@buhrmi.de](mailto:hello@buhrmi.de) to get a quote. My usual rate is $100 USD/hour (or cheaper if I really like your idea), but the initial consultation of course is free.
