## Hi there

I'm a full-stack web developer from Germany, currently living in Da Nang, Vietnam, available for hire. 

You've got an idea stuck in your head, and you *just* need an developer? Tried some things in the past that didn't work out? Ready to give it another shot? Well, I'm here. Feel free to reach out at [hello@buhrmi.de](mailto:hello@buhrmi.de).

Over the years, I've settled on my favourite tools for web app development, and combined them into my own little framework. Introducing:

### Buhrmi's App Framework

Buhrmi's App Framework is a framework for creating **buttery smooth native-like web apps** that run in browsers, mobile devices, and *probably* in desktop wrappers like Tauri. 

Its main ingredients are Ruby on Rails, Svelte and Capacitor.js, garnished with a sweet selection of my own open source packages:

- [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)<br>
  Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's Svelte adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component, inspired by Hotwire's [Turbo Frames](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/frames#eager-loading-frames).

- [Inertia X NavStack](https://github.com/buhrmi/gladi2/tree/master/app/frontend/lib/navstack)<br>
  A NavStack implementation offering buttery smooth native-like multi-modal navigation on mobile and in browsers.

- [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)<br>
  LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time. These stores can be cached locally for true offline-support.

Together, this gives you:

- Buttery smooth native-feeling navigations and interactions on mobile as well as in browsers
- Locally cacheable data for true offline-support
- SSR support for search engine optimizations
- All while using standard Rails controllers and actions, without having to develop an API
- Easily testable and extremely maintainable code

### Demo

For a small demo, check out [Gladiators Reloaded](https://github.com/buhrmi/gladi2), an open-source remake of a 2004 browser game that I'm currently working on.

<!--Here's a small demo app called [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com) - an open source alternative to Binance, Coinbase, etc. Currently in development. You can even become a shareholder by purchasing some [Revenue Share Tokens](https://www.shitcoinswap.com/$rst).-->
