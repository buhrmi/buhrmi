## Welcome to the Shitcoin Society

Hi there, I'm buhrmi, the founder and CEO of the Shitcoin Society.

Here at the Shitcoin Society our mission is to build the world's greatest platform to integrate new blockchain and DLT projects.

### Pre-Alpha

Shitcoin Society is launching in pre-alpha and we're looking for interesting projects. Are you an aspiring blockchain or DLT developer? Community manager? Broker? In case you're looking for new opportunities, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:buhrmi@shitcoinsociety.com).

## Open Source

We shamelessly utilize open source to build our platform, so of course we love to contribute back. Below you can find some of our open source efforts:

### [Inertia X Ã† A-Xii](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)

A fork of [Inertia 2.0](https://inertiajs.com) with additional features for Svelte 5

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

A new aproach to real-time data with Svelte and Ruby on Rails
