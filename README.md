# Hi there, this is buhrmi

I'm a software developer who also likes music festivals. That's why I'm currently putting together [VibeVan](https://github.com/buhrmi/vibevan), a traveling music festival and expression of inner peace.

## Open Source Stuff

Here you can find a selection of open source stuff that I'm currently working on.

### [ActionStore](https://github.com/buhrmi/actionstore)

Real-time Svelte stores for Rails. IMHO it's the best thing to happen to Rails since remote javascript.


### [Google Fonts Proxy](https://github.com/buhrmi/google-fonts-proxy)

A proxy for everyone who is concerned about [self-proclaimed "privacy lawyers"](https://www.datenschutzanwalt.eu), that send letters of cease-and-desist ("Abmahnungen") because of the usage of Google Fonts. With this proxy, your users will send their IP address to me, instead of the evil evil Google servers. Problem solved.

If you already received a cease-and-desist, please send it to me. I'll forward it into the designated trash can and upload the video of it to YouTube.
