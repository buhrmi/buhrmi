## Hi there

I'm a web developer from Germany, currently living in Da Nang, Vietnam.

Here in Vietnam the cost of living is relatively low, meaning that you can hire me very cheaply. Think $1,000 USD/month. [Send me an email](mailto:hello@buhrmi.de) if you're interested ðŸ¤ª.

I specialize in developing **native-feeling, offline-capable web apps** using Ruby on Rails, Svelte, Capacitor.js, and a sweet selection of my own open source libraries:

- [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)<br>
  Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's client-side adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component, inspired by Hotwire's Turbo Frames.

- Inertia X NavStack (coming soon)<br>
  A component library offering buttery smooth native-like navigation for Inertia X apps.

- [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)<br>
  LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time. These stores can be persisted locally for true offline-support.

Together, this gives you:

- Buttery smooth native-feeling navigation on mobile as well as browsers
- Data-over-the-wire, locally cachable for offline-support
- SSR support for search engine optimizations
- All while using standard Rails controllers and actions, without having to develop an API
- Easily testable and extremely maintainable code
