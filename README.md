## Welcome to the Shitcoin Society

Hi there, I'm buhrmi, the founder and CEO of the Shitcoin Society.

Here at the Shitcoin Society we offer bespoke blockchain development and platform integration services.

You can task us with the development of your very own blockchain and have it integrated in exchanges and trading platforms such as our very own [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinswap.com).

Feel free to contact us at [hello@shitcoinsociety.com](hello@shitcoinsociety.com) at any time.

## Open Source

We shamelessly utilize open source for our projects, so of course we love to contribute back. Below you can find some of our open source efforts:

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

A new aproach to real-time data with Svelte and Ruby on Rails

### [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertia)

An experimental fork of [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com) with additional features.

### [Thumb UI](https://github.com/buhrmi/thumb-ui)

A collection of Svelte components for creating thumb-driven user interfaces.
