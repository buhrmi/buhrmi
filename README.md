# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ruby on Rails developer and also the CEO of the [Shitcoin Society](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com). We develop a cryptographic ledger that stores Shitcoin.

## Mine Shitcoin

To mine Shitcoin, you need an account with the [Shitcoin Society](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com). There you can also view your balances and trade with other shitcoiners. Since Shitcoin is not listed on any exchanges, it's currently the only place where you can get Shitcoin.
