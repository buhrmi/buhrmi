## Hi there

This is buhrmi, a super duper web app developer. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:business@buhrmi.de) for ~shenanigans~ business.

### Current projects

- [Shitcoin Society](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com), an open-source crypto MLM platform with built-in trading engine.
- [Herr Stranzberg](https://github.com/buhrmi/stranzberg), a live AI assistant dedicated to supporting parents in the upbringing of their kids.

Sometimes you can find me [streaming on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/buhrmiproggt). Come say hi :)

<!--
- [Arena Wars](https://github.com/buhrmi/arenawars), a reimagination of an old 2004 browser game.

### Experiments

### Open source tools

> Note: These are the only actively maintained projects. There are some projects with more stars, but none of those are maintained and nobody should use them.

- **[ActiveState](https://github.com/buhrmi/activestate)**<br>
  ActiveState augments your ActionCable Channels with superpowers to update Svelte 5 state in real-time.

- **[Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)**<br>
  Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's Svelte adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component. It makes it easy to create modals, sidebars, etc with Inertia.

<!--
Here's a small demo app called [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com) - an open source alternative to Binance, Coinbase, etc. Currently in development. You can even become a shareholder by purchasing some [Revenue Share Tokens](https://www.shitcoinswap.com/$rst).-->
