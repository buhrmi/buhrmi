## Hi there

I'm a full-stack developer from Germany, currently living in Da Nang, Vietnam, available for hire.

### Buhrmi's App Framework

Buhrmi's App Framework is a framework that delivers **buttery smooth, native-feeling, offline-capable web apps**. Here is an [AI-generated summary](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/78089d82-ee60-4ddf-8dec-49ec41594526) of the benefits it provides.

It's built on Ruby on Rails, Svelte, Capacitor.js, and a sweet selection of my own open source packages:

- [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)<br>
  Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's Svelte adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component, inspired by Hotwire's Turbo Frames.

- [Inertia X NavStack](https://github.com/shitcoinsociety/shitcoinswap/tree/main/app/frontend/lib/navstack)<br>
  A NavStack implementation offering buttery smooth native-like multi-modal navigation on mobile and in browsers.

- [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)<br>
  LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time. These stores can be cached locally for true offline-support.

Together, this gives you:

- Buttery smooth native-feeling navigations and interactions on mobile as well as in browsers
- Locally cacheable data for true offline-support
- SSR support for search engine optimizations
- All while using standard Rails controllers and actions, without having to develop an API
- Easily testable and extremely maintainable code

Intrigued? If you're looking for an app developer, reach out to [hello@buhrmi.de](mailto:hello@buhrmi.de) (I don't bite). My usual rate is $100 USD/hour. Too high? I'm okay with stock options. The initial consultation is free of course. I'm also available for hire full-time.

### Demo

You can see Buhrmi's App Framework in action on [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinswap.com) - currently in development as an open source alternative to Binance, Coinbase, etc.
