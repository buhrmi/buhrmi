## Hi there

I'm buhrmi, a freelancing web developer specializing in Ruby on Rails and Svelte.

### Open Source tools

- **[ActiveState](https://github.com/buhrmi/activestate)**<br>
  ActiveState augments your ActionCable Channels with superpowers to update Svelte 5 state in real-time.

- **[Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)**<br>
  Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's Svelte adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component. It makes it easy to create modals, sidebars, etc with Inertia.

### Current projects

- **[Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinswap.com)**<br>
  The open-source crypto investment platform. By shitcoiners for shitcoiners.

<!--
Here's a small demo app called [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com) - an open source alternative to Binance, Coinbase, etc. Currently in development. You can even become a shareholder by purchasing some [Revenue Share Tokens](https://www.shitcoinswap.com/$rst).-->
