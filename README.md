# Hi, I'm buhrmi

I'm a web developer based in Da Nang, Vietnam. Currently I'm hacking on the [Shitcoin Society](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com), trying to turn it into a real thing. Occasionally I [stream DJ sets on Twitch](https://buhrmi.tv).

Here you can find some open source stuff that I wrote that help me with my projects. Hopefully they help you too, or provide some inspiration.

### [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)

Inspired by Hotwire's Turbo Frames, Inertia X is a fork of Inertia that implements the `<Frame>` component.

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time.
