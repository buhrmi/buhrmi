# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Ruby on Rails developer and browser-based game maker, currently working on the [Shitcoin Society](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com). The future of finance is here! Besides that I also [work out of my van](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmIOOckHX8wdg8nPGgetxsQ) as a web developer and put on [music festivals](https://www.opendjbooth.com).
