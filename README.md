# Hi there

I'm a web developer based in Da Nang, Vietnam, currently working on the following projects:

- [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinswap.com), an open-source alternative to Binance, Coinbase, etc.

- [VIBE Vietnam](https://x.com/vibevietnam), a music festival brand for electronic dance music.

## Open source projects

I've been developing a lot of useless crap in the past, but these are the projects I am a little bit proud of. They are designed to make it fun and easy to build offline-capable, native-feeling web apps using Ruby on Rails, Inertia, and Svelte.

### [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)

Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's client-side adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component, inspired by Hotwire's Turbo Frames.

### Inertia X NavStack (coming soon)

A component library offering buttery smooth native-like navigation for Inertia X apps.

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time. These stores can be persisted locally for offline-capable apps.
