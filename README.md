## Hi there

You've landed on the GitHub profile of a Ruby on Rails developer from Germany, currently living in Da Nang.

### Here's a bunch of open source stuff:

- **[ActiveState](https://github.com/buhrmi/activestate)**<br>
  ActiveState augments your ActionCable Channels with superpowers to update Svelte 5 state in real-time.
  
- **[Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)**<br>
  Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's Svelte adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component, inspired by Hotwire's [Turbo Frames](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/frames#eager-loading-frames).

- **[Inertia X NavStack](https://github.com/buhrmi/gladi2/tree/master/app/frontend/lib/navstack)**<br>
  A NavStack implementation offering buttery smooth native-like multi-modal navigation on mobile and in browsers.

Together, these give you:

- Buttery smooth native-feeling navigations and interactions on mobile as well as in browsers
- Locally cacheable data for true offline-support
- SSR support for search engine optimizations
- All while using standard Rails controllers and actions, without having to develop an API
- Easily testable and extremely maintainable code

I'm calling it: Buhrmi's App Framework.

For a small demo, check out [Gladiators Reloaded](https://github.com/buhrmi/gladiators), an open-source reimagination of an old 2004 browser game.

<!--Here's a small demo app called [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com) - an open source alternative to Binance, Coinbase, etc. Currently in development. You can even become a shareholder by purchasing some [Revenue Share Tokens](https://www.shitcoinswap.com/$rst).-->
