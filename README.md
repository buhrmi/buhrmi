## Welcome to the Shitcoin Society

Hi there, I'm buhrmi, Founder and CEO of the Shitcoin Society.

Here at the Shitcoin Society we use the power of tokenization to move things forward. We offer full-stack web and app development support for tokenization projects, tightly integrated with our very own [investment platform](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com) (currently available as a developer preview).

### Tokenize your startup

Tokenization makes a lot of sense for early and pre-seed startups. It's the modern way to find business partners, investors and shareholders, pay dividends, and even build communities. Are you interested in launching a tokenized project
or startup? Feel free to reach out! [Send an email](mailto:buhrmi@shitcoinsociety.com), or use this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdC9xZcfO4XTVPy7dY9nlHoYc6o1AtdZ6qYYeggH1xvaGr1Cw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit a project.

Oh, and of course make sure to sign up on https://www.shitcoinsociety.com

See you at the party ðŸš€ðŸ¥³

## Open Source

Shitcoin Society wouldn't exist without open source, so of course we love to contribute back. Below you can find some of our open source efforts:
