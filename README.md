## Welcome to the Shitcoin Society

Hi there, I'm buhrmi, your humble founder of the Shitcoin Society.

Here at the Shitcoin Society we offer full-stack web and app development services for tokenization projects, directly integrated with our [investment platform](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com) (currently in pre-alpha).

The platform's APIs allow you to easily offer custom experiences to your token holders and investors. And once everything is ready, we seamlessly migrate your tokens to a supported blockchain of your choice. All without losing functionality. So let's get started!

### Open for collaboration

Do you consider yourself a visionary? Do you have a project idea that could benefit from tokenization? Let's get in touch! [Send an email](mailto:buhrmi@shitcoinsociety.com), or use this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdC9xZcfO4XTVPy7dY9nlHoYc6o1AtdZ6qYYeggH1xvaGr1Cw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit an idea.

Oh, and of course make sure to sign up on https://www.shitcoinsociety.com

See you at the party ðŸš€ðŸ¥³
