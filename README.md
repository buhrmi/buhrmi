## Hi there

I'm a full-stack web developer from Germany, currently living in Da Nang, Vietnam, available for hire. Yes, I can help you with the HTML and the CSS. But my real passion lies in application development and tooling, as opposed to mere websites. That's why I'm creating my own app framework. Introducing:

### Buhrmi's App Framework

Buhrmi's App Framework is a framework for creating **buttery smooth native-like web apps** that run in browsers, mobile devices, and *probably* in desktop wrappers like Tauri. 

Its main ingredients are Ruby on Rails, Svelte and Capacitor.js, garnished with a sweet selection of my own open source packages:

- [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)<br>
  Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's Svelte adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component, inspired by Hotwire's [Turbo Frames](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/frames#eager-loading-frames).

- [Inertia X NavStack](https://github.com/shitcoinsociety/shitcoinswap/tree/main/app/frontend/lib/navstack)<br>
  A NavStack implementation offering buttery smooth native-like multi-modal navigation on mobile and in browsers.

- [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)<br>
  LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time. These stores can be cached locally for true offline-support.

Together, this gives you:

- Buttery smooth native-feeling navigations and interactions on mobile as well as in browsers
- Locally cacheable data for true offline-support
- SSR support for search engine optimizations
- All while using standard Rails controllers and actions, without having to develop an API
- Easily testable and extremely maintainable code

Here is an [AI-generated summary](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/78089d82-ee60-4ddf-8dec-49ec41594526).

Intrigued? If you're looking for an app developer, feel free to reach out to [hello@buhrmi.de](mailto:hello@buhrmi.de). The usual rate is around $100 USD/hour, which is negotiable (think revenue share, stock options, etc). I'm also open to full-time positions.

### Demo

Here's a small demo app called [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com) - an open source alternative to Binance, Coinbase, etc. Currently in development. You can even become a shareholder by purchasing some [Revenue Share Tokens](https://www.shitcoinswap.com/$rst).
