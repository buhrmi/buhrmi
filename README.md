## Open Source

Here you can find some of our open source efforts that we use on a day-to-day basis.

### [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)

Positioned as an alternative to Hotwire, Inertia X is our preferred way to build native-feeling apps using Ruby on Rails.

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time.
