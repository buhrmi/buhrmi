# Hi I'm buhrmi

After spending the larger part of my life working as a web developer, I am currently traveling around trying my luck as an independent crypto broker. For this purpose I have founded the Shitty Investments Club. Feel free to [reach out](https://www.shitcoinswap.com/about) if you'd like to join the team.

## Current projects

- [Momentum](https://github.com/momentum-foundation/whitepaper), an experimental blockchain platform implementing Proof-of-Popularity (PoP). 
- [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinswap.com), my very own poop-branded, open-source trading platform.
  
## Open Source

- [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertia), a fork of [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com) with additional features.
