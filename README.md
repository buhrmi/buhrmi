## Hi there I'm buhrmi

I'm best described as a full-stack app developer specializing in [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). 

## Startups

Here are some startups I'm currently working on:

### [Hidden Base](https://www.hiddenbase.app)

Coming soon: The free-to-use Gigwell alternative that you should have scouted for earlier.

### [VIBE](https://vibe.tokyo)

The futuristic artist booking agency.

## Open Source

Here you can find some of my own open source efforts that I use on a day-to-day basis.

### [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)

Positioned as an alternative to Hotwire, Inertia X is my preferred way to build native-feeling apps using Ruby on Rails.

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time.
