## Welcome to the Shitcoin Society

Hi there, I'm buhrmi, Founder and CEO of the Shitcoin Society.

Here at the Shitcoin Society we're building the ultimate [tokenization platform](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com) and offer free development and consultation packages for promising projects and startups that are interested in utilizing our platform and integrating with it.

Do you have an interesting project idea that can benefit from tokenization? Let's team up! [Send an email](mailto:buhrmi@shitcoinsociety.com), or use this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdC9xZcfO4XTVPy7dY9nlHoYc6o1AtdZ6qYYeggH1xvaGr1Cw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit a project.

Oh, and of course make sure to sign up on https://www.shitcoinsociety.com

See you at the shareholder party ðŸš€ðŸ¥³

## Open Source

Shitcoin Society wouldn't exist without open source, so of course we love to contribute back. Here you can find some of our open source projects that we're using to build our product:

### [Inertia X Ã† A-Xii](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)

Positioned as an alternative to Hotwire, Inertia X is our preferred way to build native-feeling apps using Ruby on Rails.

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to directly update Svelte stores from the backend. It's a new way to build real-time apps with Ruby on Rails and Svelte, and works seamlessly with Inertia X.
