## Hi there

Thanks for visiting! This is buhrmi, a freelancing web developer specializing in Ruby on Rails and Svelte.

### Open Source tools

- **[ActiveState](https://github.com/buhrmi/activestate)**<br>
  ActiveState augments your ActionCable Channels with superpowers to update Svelte 5 state in real-time.

- **[Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)**<br>
  Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's Svelte adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component. It makes it easy to create modals, sidebars, etc with Inertia.
