## Welcome to the Shitcoin Society

Hi there, I'm buhrmi, the founder and CEO of the Shitcoin Society.

Here at the Shitcoin Society we offer bespoke platform development and integration services.

Are you working on a blockchain or DLT and would like to integrate it into a trading platform? Reach out at [buhrmi@shitcoinsociety.com](buhrmi@shitcoinsociety.com).

## Open Source

We shamelessly utilize open source for our projects, so of course we love to contribute back. Below you can find some of our open source efforts:

### [Inertia X Æ A-Xii](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)

A fork of [Inertia 2.0](https://inertiajs.com) with additional features for Svelte 5

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

A new aproach to real-time data with Svelte and Ruby on Rails

### [Thumb UI](https://github.com/buhrmi/thumb-ui)

A collection of Svelte components for creating thumb-driven user interfaces. Currently working on Thumb UI 2.0 which will be built on top of Inertia X.
