# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelancing developer specializing in Ruby on Rails and Svelte.

### Do you like music?

Come check out my [Open DJ Booth](https://www.opendjbooth.com) project.

### Do you like open source stuff?

Here you can find a selection of open source stuff that I'm currently working on.

#### [ActionStore](https://github.com/buhrmi/actionstore)

Real-time Svelte stores for Rails. IMHO it's the best thing to happen to Rails since remote javascript.


#### [Google Fonts Proxy](https://github.com/buhrmi/google-fonts-proxy)

A proxy for everyone who is concerned about [self-proclaimed "privacy lawyers"](https://www.datenschutzanwalt.eu), that send letters of cease-and-desist ("Abmahnungen") because of the usage of Google Fonts. With this proxy, your users will send their IP address to me, instead of the evil evil Google servers. Problem solved.

If you already received a cease-and-desist, please send it to me. I'll forward it into the designated trash can and upload the video of it to YouTube.

#### Contributions

I'm a contributor to [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com)

### Do you like hard trap?

On my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/buhrmi) you can find some mashups and someday maybe even original tunes
