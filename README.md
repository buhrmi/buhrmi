## Hi there

I'm a web developer living in Da Nang, Vietnam. It's awesome here and you should come.

These days I spend my free time developing the technical foundation for the [Shitcoin Society](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com), an open-source trading platform and crypto-launchpad.

All libraries and frameworks that the Shitcoin Society has developed are being made available open source:

- **[Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)**<br>
  Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's Svelte adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component. It makes it easy to create modals, sidebars, etc with Inertia.

- **[ActiveState](https://github.com/buhrmi/activestate)**<br>
  ActiveState augments your ActionCable Channels with superpowers to update Svelte 5 state in real-time.  

- **[Inertia X NavStack](https://github.com/buhrmi/gladi2/tree/master/app/frontend/lib/navstack)**<br>
  A NavStack implementation on top of Inertia X, offering smooth multi-modal navigation on mobile and in browsers.

### Projects using this tech stack

- [Arena Wars](https://github.com/buhrmi/arenawars), an open-source reimagination of an old 2004 browser game.
- [Shitcoin Society](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com), an open-source trading platform and crypto launchpad

<!--Here's a small demo app called [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com) - an open source alternative to Binance, Coinbase, etc. Currently in development. You can even become a shareholder by purchasing some [Revenue Share Tokens](https://www.shitcoinswap.com/$rst).-->
