## Welcome to the Shitcoin Society

Hi there, I'm buhrmi, your humble founder of the Shitcoin Society.

Here at the Shitcoin Society our goal is to build the world's greatest platform for your blockchain, DLT, and tokenization projects.

### Get involved

We're currently in the pre-alpha testing phase and always on the lookout for interesting project ideas. Do you consider yourself a visionary? Or even a developer? We want to hear from you!
