## Welcome to the Shitcoin Society

Hi there, I'm buhrmi, the founder and CEO of the Shitcoin Society.

Here at the Shitcoin Society our mission is to build the world's greatest investment platform for blockchain and DLT developers.

### Pre-alpha sign up

Are you an inspiring blockchain or DLT developer and interested in integrating with an upcoming new platform? We're building in public and always looking for new integration partners. Sign up for a test-drive at [testing.shitcoinsociety.com](https://testing.shitcoinsociety.com).

## Open Source

We shamelessly utilize open source for our projects, so of course we love to contribute back. Below you can find some of our open source efforts:

### [Inertia X Æ A-Xii](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)

A fork of [Inertia 2.0](https://inertiajs.com) with additional features for Svelte 5

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

A new aproach to real-time data with Svelte and Ruby on Rails

### [Thumb UI](https://github.com/buhrmi/thumb-ui)

A collection of Svelte components for creating thumb-driven user interfaces. Currently working on Thumb UI 2.0 which will be built on top of Inertia X.
