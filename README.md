## Welcome to the Shitcoin Society

Hi there, I'm buhrmi, Founder and CEO of the Shitcoin Society.

Here at the Shitcoin Society we're building the ultimate [tokenization platform](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com). We offer free app development support for promising projects and startups that are interested in utilizing our platform and integrate with it.

### What's tokenization?

Tokenization is the modern way to find business partners, investors and shareholders, pay dividends, and even build communities. It's a digital representation of share ownership, and makes a lot of sense for early stage startups.

### That's cool and all, but how do you make money?

Glad you asked! It all comes down to the business model. The business model of the Shitcoin Society is to provide free app development support in exchange for company tokens. These tokens represent ownership of company shares that can be sold and traded, and entitle the holder to dividends and other project-specific benefits - not unlike conventional stock that is traded on stock exchanges. This structure incentivizes all involved parties to build useful and functional apps that people love to use. Even the Shitcoin Society itself is about to be tokenized. Stat tuned - you won't want to miss that announcement.

### Tokenize your project

Are you interested in launching your own tokenized project? Or tokenize an existing startup? Let's team up! [Send an email](mailto:buhrmi@shitcoinsociety.com), or use this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdC9xZcfO4XTVPy7dY9nlHoYc6o1AtdZ6qYYeggH1xvaGr1Cw/viewform?usp=sf_link) to submit a project.

Oh, and of course make sure to sign up on https://www.shitcoinsociety.com

See you at the party ðŸš€ðŸ¥³

## Open Source

Shitcoin Society wouldn't exist without open source, so of course we love to contribute back. Here you can find some of our open source projects that we're using to build our product:

### [Inertia X Ã† A-Xii](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)

An alternative to Hotwire, Inertia X is our preferred library to build native-feeling progressive web apps using Ruby on Rails.

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to directly update Svelte stores from the backend. It's a new way to build real-time apps with Ruby on Rails and Svelte, and works seamlessly with Inertia X.
