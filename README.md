## Welcome to the Shitcoin Society

Hi there, I'm buhrmi, the founder and CEO of the Shitcoin Society.

Here at the Shitcoin Society our mission is to offer you the world's greatest investment platform for blockchain and DLT projects.

### Pre-Alpha

Shitcoin Society is launching in pre-alpha and we're looking for interesting projects to integrate. Are you an aspiring blockchain or DLT developer? Web developer? Broker? Even if you're just looking for new opportunities, let's [get in touch](mailto:buhrmi@shitcoinsociety.com).

And of course, don't forget to [sign up](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com). 

## Open Source

We shamelessly utilize open source to build our platform, so of course we love to contribute back. Below you can find some of our open source efforts:

### [Inertia X Æ A-Xii](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)
