## Welcome to the Shitcoin Society

Hi there, I'm buhrmi, the founder and CEO of the Shitcoin Society.

Here at the Shitcoin Society we offer bespoke blockchain development and integration services.

You can task us with the development of your very own blockchain and have it integrated in exchanges and trading platforms such as our very own [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinswap.com) (shameless plug).

Feel free to contact us at [hello@shitcoinsociety.com](hello@shitcoinsociety.com) at any time.

## Open Source
