## Hi there

I'm a full-stack web developer from Germany, currently living in Da Nang, Vietnam, available for hire. Yes, I can help you with the HTML and the CSS. But my real passion lies in application development and tooling, as opposed to mere websites. That's why I've created my own app framework. Introducing:

### Buhrmi's App Framework

Buhrmi's App Framework makes it easy to create **buttery smooth, native-feeling, offline-capable web apps**. Check out this [AI-generated summary](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/78089d82-ee60-4ddf-8dec-49ec41594526).

The framework consists of Ruby on Rails, Svelte, Capacitor.js, and a sweet selection of my own open source packages:

- [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)<br>
  Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's Svelte adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component, inspired by Hotwire's Turbo Frames.

- [Inertia X NavStack](https://github.com/shitcoinsociety/shitcoinswap/tree/main/app/frontend/lib/navstack)<br>
  A NavStack implementation offering buttery smooth native-like multi-modal navigation on mobile and in browsers.

- [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)<br>
  LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time. These stores can be cached locally for true offline-support.

Together, this gives you:

- Buttery smooth native-feeling navigations and interactions on mobile as well as in browsers
- Locally cacheable data for true offline-support
- SSR support for search engine optimizations
- All while using standard Rails controllers and actions, without having to develop an API
- Easily testable and extremely maintainable code

Intrigued? If you're looking for an app developer, reach out to [hello@buhrmi.de](mailto:hello@buhrmi.de). My usual rate is $100 USD/hour. Too high? I'm okay with stock options. The initial consultation is free of course. I'm also available for hire full-time.

### Demo

My startup [Shitcoin Society](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com) is using this framework to develop [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinswap.com) - an open source alternative to Binance, Coinbase, etc.

By the way, so far we have raised $0. Let me know if you'd like to come on board as early investor ðŸ˜„
