## Hi there I'm buhrmi

I'm best described as a full-stack app developer person specializing in [Ruby on Rails](https://www.rubyonrails.org) and [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). In my free time I'm currently developing an artist booking app together with [this guy](https://app.vibe.tokyo/@twztd).

## Open Source

Here you can find some of my own open source efforts that I use on a day-to-day basis.

### [Inertia X Æ A-Xii](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)

Positioned as an alternative to Hotwire, Inertia X is my preferred way to build native-feeling apps using Ruby on Rails.

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time and works seamlessly with Inertia X.
