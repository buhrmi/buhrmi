## Welcome to the Shitcoin Society

Hi there, I'm buhrmi, the founder and CEO of the Shitcoin Society.

Here at the Shitcoin Society our mission is to offer you the world's greatest investment platform for blockchain and DLT projects.

### Platform Pre-Alpha

Are you an aspiring blockchain or DLT developer? Integration expert? Web developer? Broker? 

Sign up for the [Shitcoin Society pre-alpha](https://testing.shitcoinsociety.com). As an alpha user you get to test all the features before anyone else. Also, we're always looking for new projects to add to the platform. [Get in touch](mailto:buhrmi@shitcoinsociety.com) if you'd like to collaborate. 

## Open Source

We shamelessly utilize open source to build our platform, so of course we love to contribute back. Below you can find some of our open source efforts:

### [Inertia X Æ A-Xii](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)

A fork of [Inertia 2.0](https://inertiajs.com) with additional features for Svelte 5

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

A new aproach to real-time data with Svelte and Ruby on Rails
