# Hi, I'm buhrmi

I'm a web developer based in Da Nang, Vietnam.

These days I'm busy working on startup ideas that might or might not work (mostly not).

One of these startups is [Shitcoin Society](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com), and its very first product: [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinswap.com).

Another one is [VIBE](https://vibe.buhrmi.de), a music festival brand for electronic dance music.

Oh, and if you like drum n bass, you should come over to my [Twitch channel](https://twitch.com/therealbuhrmi) where I sometimes do IRL jungling streams.

## Projects

Here you can find some open source projects. Maybe they're useful to you too.

### [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)

Inspired by Hotwire's Turbo Frames, Inertia X is a fork of Inertia that implements the `<Frame>` component.

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time.
