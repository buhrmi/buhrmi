## Hi there

I'm a web developer from Germany, currently living in Da Nang, Vietnam. I can help you develop **first class, native-feeling, offline-capable web apps**.

Here in Vietnam the cost of living is relatively low, meaning that you can hire me very cheaply. Think $1,000 USD/month. [Send me an email](mailto:hello@buhrmi.de) if you're interested ðŸ¤ª.

The only drawback is that I'm very picky when it comes to the technology I'm working with: I work **exclusively with Ruby on Rails and Svelte**. While many people behave like sheep and flock to React or other frameworks, I tend to go my own route. Even within my own beloved Rails community, there is a push these days to use Hotwire Native to develop native apps, which I don't like. Hotwire Native still uses server-side rendered templates, which goes against my understanding of "offline-capable".

That's why I'm developing my own stack. It offers the following benefits:

- Buttery smooth native-feeling navigation that works on mobile (using Capacitor.js) and web
- Data-over-the-wire, locally cachable for offline-support
- SSR support for search engine optimizations
- All while using standard Rails controllers and actions, without having to develop an API

Building on Ruby on Rails, Svelte, and Capacitor.js, this stack introduces of the following libraries and frameworks:

- [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)<br>
  Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's client-side adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component, inspired by Hotwire's Turbo Frames.

- Inertia X NavStack (coming soon)<br>
  A component library offering buttery smooth native-like navigation for Inertia X apps.

- [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)<br>
  LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time. These stores can be persisted locally for true offline-support.
