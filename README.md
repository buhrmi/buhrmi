# Hi there

I'm a web developer based in Da Nang, Vietnam, currently working on startup ideas.

- [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinswap.com), an open-source alternative to Binance, Coinbase, etc.

- [VIBE Vietnam](https://instagram.com/vibe_vietnam), a music festival brand for electronic dance music.

## Open source stuff

For the above startup ideas I've been looking for a good way to implement offline-capable, native-feeling web apps using my favourite tools: Ruby on Rails and Svelte. These days, the Rails community is pushing for Hotwire Native to develop native apps. Unfortunately, I'm not a fan of HTML-over-the-wire (Hotwire) and server-side rendered templates - that goes against the concept of offline-first. So I'm developing my own open source "dream stack" that does not use Hotwire. It consists of these projects:

### [Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)

Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's client-side adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component, inspired by Hotwire's Turbo Frames.

### Inertia X NavStack (coming soon)

A component library offering buttery smooth native-like navigation for Inertia X apps.

### [LiveStores](https://github.com/buhrmi/livestores)

LiveStores augment Rails' ActionCable Channels with methods to update Svelte stores in real-time. These stores can be persisted locally for offline-capable apps.
