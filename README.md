## Hi there

I'm buhrmi, freelancing web developer specializing in Svelte and Ruby on Rails, available for hire.

### Current projects

- [SmartCoin](https://www.smartcoin.dev), an attempt at a Bitcoin MLM platform. Currently invite-only.
- [Arena Wars](https://github.com/buhrmi/arenawars), an open-source reimagination of an old 2004 browser game.

### Open source

I've extracted some of the code I'm using to build the apps above into their own open-source projects. Maybe they'll be useful to you too.

- **[ActiveState](https://github.com/buhrmi/activestate)**<br>
  ActiveState augments your ActionCable Channels with superpowers to update Svelte 5 state in real-time.

- **[Inertia X](https://github.com/buhrmi/inertiax)**<br>
  Inertia X is a drop-in replacement for Inertia's Svelte adapter, adding the `<Frame>` component. It makes it easy to create modals, sidebars, etc with Inertia.

<!--
Here's a small demo app called [Shitcoin Swap](https://www.shitcoinsociety.com) - an open source alternative to Binance, Coinbase, etc. Currently in development. You can even become a shareholder by purchasing some [Revenue Share Tokens](https://www.shitcoinswap.com/$rst).-->
