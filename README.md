# Hi there

Once upon a time I wanted to become the world's greatest tearout dubstep DJ. But then I settled for web developer.

## Currently bootstrapping
- [Shitcoin Swap](https://github.com/buhrmi/shitcoinswap/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#shitcoin-swap), my very own poop-branded trading platform.
- [VIBE](https://vibe.tokyo), a platform for music event organization and promotion, launching in Tokyo.
